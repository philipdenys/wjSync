1. You can now apply a language to the URL query like this: culture=language
   When language is not set the contact language is used.
   the following languages are accepted : de-DE, en-GB, es, fr-FR, nl-BE.
   you can also set keepSpecsKeys to "yes" which will keep the specs keys in the original format (english).

### Examples:

• /services/api/integrations/complete-customer-pricelist/dbcee1c1-97a9-48bd-ad80-ec2a43604bc3?culture=fr-FR :will present this in french values and sepc keys.
• /services/api/integrations/complete-customer-pricelist/dbcee1c1-97a9-48bd-ad80-ec2a43604bc3?culture=fr-FR&keepSpecsKeys=yes :will present this in french values but sepc keys remain english.
keepSpecsKeys works without specifying "culture" too

2. Use this URL for status updates: /services/api/integrations/complete-customer-pricelist-status/dbcee1c1-97a9-48bd-ad80-ec2a43604bc3/
